## Sustainability Goals

This project was developed to participate in Impact Track of ETHDenver 2019. As part of this Impact Track we identified that JobSimple meets the following goals of [UN Sustainability and Development|http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html].

## Part 1: UN Sustainable Development Goals

## Goal 1: No Poverty
JobSimple connects workers directly with sponsors on a transparent and open marketplace. By eliminating the employment agencies that often facilitate this process, we will greatly reduce the opportunity for corruption that has proven to be rampant. Lack of transparency in the recruitment industry means agency can easily falsify migration and recruitment costs. This both increases the cost of the labor for the sponsor and decrease the income for the workers and their families. 
Incentivizing Sponsors
By creating an open marketplace with transparent immigration costs and procedures, we can facilitate delivering lower-cost, higher skilled labor to corporations who need. This provides a significant incentive for Sponsors to participate in the JobSimple marketplace. 
Empowering workers
Open access to information will give workers a better understanding of their true value in the Job Market

## Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being
(RoadMap) JobSimple will provide smart-contract infrastructure to ensure affordable sponsor-provided health-care plans. 
Goal 4: Quality Education
JobSimple connects to a lending platform to provide funds either through a community loan pool or Sponsor provided funds for pre-job skill training. These training programs will provide valuable skills that workers can use beyond immediate job requirements for long term career advancement. 
Workers can borrow from a community lending pool to connect with in-network training providers to learn necessary skills to apply for the jobs they are interested in applying for. 
Sponsors can stake funds for in-network training programs to allow workers to earn necessary certifications to fulfill visa requirements when needed. 

## Goal 5: Gender Equality
JobSimple keeps gender identity hidden from Sponsors until the interview process is initiated. Gender Anonymity in the worker matching process to provide a framework that promotes equality between women and men. 
JobSimple requires Sponsors to set a fixed salary for positions they are hiring for that cannot be lowered after initiating the interview process with a potential worker.
(RoadMap) Salary is paid via a smart contract on a monthly basis directly to workers after beginning work. 

## Goal 8: Decent work and Economic Growth
JobSimple will deliver higher salaries to workers through a transparent relationship between the worker and Sponsor. 
A direct relationship between the sponsor and worker means workers will know exactly what jobs they are interviewing for and won’t be placed inappropriately in jobs they are not interested in or do not have the right skills for
(Road Map) 
Sponsors are required to maintain a wallet balance of a minimum of 3 months worth of funds to fulfill Salary payments for all existing employment smart contracts. This will at a minimum, prevent the termination of an employment arrangement without significant notice and opportunity for conflict resolution

## Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and infrastructure
We are leveraging the ethereum blockchain to provide an open and transparent digital infrastructure that represents significant technological progress towards lasting economic solutions: providing access to higher paying jobs for workers and better labor for sponsors. 

## Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities
The transparency provided by a decentralized job marketplace will lead to greater income equality. 
JobSimple hides personal information such as sex, race or ethnicity to promote equal access to the hiring process for workers.
JobSimple will facilitate safer migration and mobility of people to the countries where they would like to work by removing often predatory recruitment agencies from the migration process. 

## Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions
The core of the problem we are addressing with our project is the abuses suffered by migrant workers by corrupt recruitment agencies. 
Recruitment agencies are known to have committed the following human rights violations to migrant workers
Migrant worker ID confiscation
Using workers as mules to illegally import / export contraband when migrating to / from the country they plan to work in. 
Withholding paychecks or taking an undeserved and undisclosed portion of workers’ salaries.
